| 2019-11-04  | 1       | Setup Github Repository and first time reporting. |
| 2019-11-04  | 1       | Research on nodeJS and MongoDB. |
| 2019-11-04  | 1       | Research on Web Development. |
| 2019-11-05  | 1       | Setup issues and project on Github and coming up with an initial architecture of the system. |
| 2019-11-05  | 4       | Started to build the RESTful API (model, controller, routes). Also created a first simulator of wind speed and household electric consumption. |
| 2019-11-05  | 1       | Updated time report to appropriate model. |
| 2019-11-12  | 2       | Work progress with simulator and for wind, demand and price. Basically trying to build a model by hand before implementing. |
| 2019-11-13  | 4       | Further work with api for gathering specific data to server from mongodb. |
| 2019-11-14  | 1       | Updated simulator for households consumptions. |
| 2019-11-14  | 3       | Work progress for API for specific prosumer to update its consumption in DB. |
| 2019-11-14  | 1       | Watched tutorials on how to apply microservices in order to keep the architecture clean. |
| 2019-11-15  | 1       | Refactored the project and split up server to one separate module for the simulator. |
| 2019-11-18  | 5       | Introduced current price to the simulator based on the last wind and demand, had some problems on how to run it asynchronously based on the last wind and demand but it worked out in the end. |
| 2019-11-20  | 9       | Added helper files for connections to different databases. Updated models for prosumer and its API. |
| 2019-11-21  | 1       | Progress on production simulator, problems remains within the different connections. |
